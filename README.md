# Rover GUI

Primary GUI for using the rover. Uses SvelteKit, Skeleton, Typescript, and roslibjs.

## Compatibility

Development and testing is done on Ubuntu Chromium. Compatability with Windows Chromium (Chrome, Edge, etc) is also expected.

Other browsers and MacOS are known to have issues with the GUI and are not supported.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Duplicate `.env.example`, rename it to `.env` and change the values to match your setup.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`

## Building

Building the GUI for deployment has not been tested yet.
