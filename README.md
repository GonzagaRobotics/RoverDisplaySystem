# Rover GUI

Primary GUI for using the rover. Uses SvelteKit, Typescript, and roslibjs.

## Compatibility

Development and testing is done on Windows 10/11 Firefox. Other modern browsers should work fine, but there may be subtle issues.

There are known, potentially breaking issues with Linux, although the GUI can still connect to the rover.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the values to match your setup.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`

## Building

Building the GUI for deployment has not been tested yet.
